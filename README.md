# Frontend in 7 Days — Starter (V2)

Deploy:
1. Upload this folder's contents to a new GitHub repo.
2. Import the repo to Vercel (Add New → Project).
3. Add env vars in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:
   - RESEND_API_KEY
   - OWNER_EMAIL = iamezhinskiy@gmail.com
   - MAIL_FROM = Frontend in 7 Days <no-reply@yourdomain.com>
4. Open the site and submit the form.

If GitHub doesn't include the `app/` folder on upload, make sure you **drag & drop the folder**, not the file picker.
